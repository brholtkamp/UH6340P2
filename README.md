## Project Description

### Requirements

* g++
* make
* C++ 11 support

### Usage

    ./project2 test.txt

### Overview
This project consists of a `tree` component that is the modified implementation of a B+ tree with the deletion algorithm changed to only remove nodes upon hitting 0 keys.  The `tree`'s degree can be modified with constants at the top of the file.

The `studentRecord` class handles the block component and can be modified using the constants at the top of the file.

## Project Information

###Objective
This project will give you an opportunity to familiarize
with the most commonly used data organization, B+
trees.

###The Problem
You are given a list of between 400 and 500 student
names containing a significant number of duplicates.
As these names will not be case sensitive Doe, John, \
doe, john and DOE, JOHN will represent the same
student. You might therefore want to store your keys in
some canonical form, such as all lower case ore all
upper case. No name will ever occupy more than 32
characters. To each distinct student name, we want to
attach 224 bytes of confidential information that will
initially contain 224 blank characters. Hence we can fit
four student records in a one kilobyte block.
You are to write a program using a B+ tree
organization to manage these data. Given that that each
pointer occupies 64 bits, each B+ tree node will contain
10 keys and 11 pointers. Your program should be able:

1. To `INSERT` new student records into a possibly
empty table;
2. To `SEARCH` for the record of a given student
and print it out (name and confidential
information);
3. To `LIST` all students names in the appropriate
order.
4. To `UPDATE` a given student record;
5. To `DELETE` a given student record.
6. 
Your `INSERT` procedure should be able to detect
duplicate names, reject them and write an error
message. Your `SEARCH` and `DELETE` procedures should
act in the same way when asked to access or delete
records that do not exist.

To get full credit, your `LIST` procedure should be
implemented efficiently using the 11th pointer of the
leave nodes of your B+ tree.

To simplify your life and make the assignment
more interesting, your `DELETE` procedure should not
merge B+ tree nodes when one or more records they
point to are deleted. You should wait instead until the
node is empty then delete it.

###The Input Data
Your input data will consist of a list of record
specifications separated by keywords as in:

    *INSERT
    Walker, Chris
    Toleti, Srinivas
    WALKER, CHRIS
    Rawlinson, Edward M
    Mason, Eric J
    Wu, Chang‚ÄêYu
    *SNAPSHOT
    *SEARCH
    rawlinson, edward m
    Wong, Qun
    *INSERT
    Chiang, Mark
    *DELETE
    Long, Robert
    *SNAPSHOT
    *UPDATE
    WALKER, CHRIS
    New project.

Note that the information to be inserted in the
confidential information field of a student record only
appear in input lines describing updates and will
always start on a new line.

All keywords will always start in column 2 and be
preceded by an asterisk in column 1. Every time you
program encounters the keyword `SNAPSHOT`, it should
print out a summary of the current structure of the
current index tree. This output should include:

1. The number of records in your table;
2. The number of blocks occupied by these data,
B+ tree nodes excluded;
3. The depth of your B+ tree;
4. The first and last key of all your B+ tree
nodes.

You will soon be provided with a sample data file
available from the course page.
